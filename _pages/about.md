Hi, I am Jingxuan Wu, a third-year Big Data Science major at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen. I am deeply passionate about leveraging advanced machine learning and data science techniques to solve complex, real-world problems. My academic journey and research experiences have equipped me with a robust understanding of various machine learning methodologies, optimization techniques, and statistical analyses.

### Education and Academic Background

I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Data Science and Big Data Technology, maintaining a GPA of 3.62/4.00. Throughout my academic career, I have taken numerous relevant courses such as Advanced Machine Learning, Optimization, Data Structures, Probability, and Statistics. My dedication to academic excellence has been recognized with multiple honors, including the Deanâ€™s List and the Undergraduate Research Assistantship.

### Research Experience

#### Resource Allocation for Machine Learning Tasks
- **Institution**: University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
- **Supervisor**: Prof. Guanting Chen
- **Duration**: May 2024 - Present
- Developed predictive models using large language models (LLMs) to optimize runtime and energy consumption of machine learning tasks on various GPUs. This project aims to enhance resource allocation efficiency through real-time decision algorithms.

#### Airport Congestion Contagion Modeling
- **Institution**: The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen
- **Supervisor**: Prof. Jianfeng Mao
- **Duration**: Dec 2023 - Present
- Improved heterogeneous Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) models to predict and manage airport congestion contagion. This involved adaptive graph learning techniques and demonstrated superior performance in predicting airport delay statuses.

#### Optimization of Guangzhou Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Public Road Usage
- **Institution**: University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
- **Supervisor**: Prof. Guanting Chen
- **Duration**: Jan 2024 - Present
- Combined integer optimization and machine learning to solve public road usage issues. Techniques like LSTM, transformers, and random forests were utilized for data filling, and optimization models were built to improve public road usage efficiency.

### Publications and Projects

- **Flight Delay Propagation Modeling**: Authored a comprehensive review on airport delay propagation methods, which was accepted by the Transportation Research Part E.
- **Lithology Based Rock Prediction**: Conducted research on predicting rock properties using machine learning models like SVM and HMM.
- **COSCO Shipping Analysis**: Enhanced maritime intelligent systems through clustering, route prediction, and congestion analysis.

### Competitions and Awards

- **Mathematical Contest In Modeling (MCM)**: Led a team to optimize Great Lakes water levels using advanced statistical and machine learning models, receiving the Meritorious Winner award.

### Future Goals

I am actively seeking opportunities for a Ph.D. position in Fall 2025 to further my research in machine learning, optimization, and operations research. I aim to continue exploring innovative solutions to complex problems and contribute to advancements in data science.
